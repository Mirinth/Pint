Pint interprets a language. It reads the directions and follows them exactly as told. This explains how to talk in The Language.

The rules of The Language are very simple.

- The Language has exactly one Code File.
- The Code File is named "code.pcf"
- The Code File is in the same folder as Pint.
- The Code File has Digits and Line Ends.
- Lines can have up to 9 Digits.
- Lines with zero characters are ignored.
- Lines with less than zero characters are also ignored.
- The number from the last line is shown on the screen.
- If anything bad happens, Pint gives up and quits.

The End.
