Pint spec
version 1/(∞ - 1)



Pint interprets a language. It reads the directions and follows them exactly as told. This explains how to talk in The Language.

The rules of The Language are very simple.

- The Language has exactly one Code File.
- Pint uses whatever data source you give it as its Code File.
- The Code File can be anywhere, everywhere, and nowhere.
- The Code File has letters, numbers, spaces, equal signs, and line ends.
- Each line looks like "abc = 123"
- The letters are variable names; the numbers are the values.
- Numbers can be up to 9 digits. Names can be any length.
- Empty lines are ignored
- Each name and its final value is shown on the screen.
- If anything bad happens, Pint gives up and quits.

The End.
